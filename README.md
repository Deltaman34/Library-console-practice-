# C-Library-console-practice-
That's the project from college I have done.There are many tasks that include logic relation and picking up right variables.This is my first huge project  I've been doing it for a month because of poor knowledge of data structure .Lookig at it now,I could say that the project is  bad...really bad,altough,it works well
